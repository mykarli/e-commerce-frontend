# 🛒 E-Commerce Frontend Application

## Overview
This project is a modern e-commerce frontend application designed to simulate a real-world online shopping experience.  
The main focus is on **user experience**, **scalable UI architecture**, and **product-oriented development** rather than just feature delivery.

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs
- Chose a component-based architecture to keep the UI scalable as product features grow.
- Preferred centralized state handling to manage cart and checkout flows consistently.
